List the most important features in the chest X-ray for identifying "pneumonia":

-opacity: more opaque and less transparent, appearing whiter or cloudier than the surrounding lung tissue.
-shape:  irregular, patchy areas in the lung.
-texture: fluffy or grainy texture within the lung area, similar to a snowy TV screen.
-border: fuzzy or unclear, blending into the surrounding lung tissue.
-location: vary in different parts of the lung.
-patterns: cloudy areas that are not evenly spread and have a clustered or patchy appearance.
-fluid: fluid accumulation or effusion with cloudy appearance.
-other: asymmetric appearance between two chest's sides, cloudiness near the lung's edges, dark lines standing out against the cloudy background.

List the most important features in the chest X-ray for identifying "pneumothorax":

-opacity: less opaque and more transparent, often appearing darker.
-shape: sharp, clear, and distinct line at the edge of the lung.
-texture: empty, smooth, dark, mottled and lucent texture.
-border: clear and sharp like a straight line.
-location: often located near the lung's edges or the lung's apex.
-patterns: no specific patterns, like an empty space. 
-fluid: no fluid or effusion accumulation.
-others: asymmetric appearance between two chest's sides; dark area; sharper contrast between the lung and the ribs; and reduced lung volume.

List the most important features in the chest X-ray for identifying "edema":

-opacity: more opaque, more white, and less transparent, appearing like a small and cloudy patch.
-shape: usually a round and oval patch, no clear and sharp shape.
-texture: grainy, uneven, patchy, or dense texture.
-border: hazy, unclear, blending into the surrounding lung tissue.
-location: more localization in a specific part of the lung.
-patterns: no specific patterns, like a patch of cloudiness.
-fluid: no fluid or effusion accumulation.
-other: asymmetric apperance; lung collapse; concentrated, cloudy area in a specific region of the lung; major bronchi may shift towards the affected side.

List the most important features in the chest X-ray for identifying "pulmonary edema":

-opacity: more opaque, and less transparent, appearing like a cloudy or hazy spot.
-shape: typically spreads out irregularly, not in a clear, defined shape.
-texture: fine, grainy, or mottled texture within the cloudy area, looking like small, speckled spots.
-border: fuzzy or blurred, gradually blending into the surrounding lung tissue.
-location: usually affects both lungs and often located at the lung's base.
-patterns: uniform density with a \"bat-wing\" or \"butterfly\" pattern.
-fluid: fluid accumulation or effusion with cloudy appearance.
-other: increased vascular markings, increased heart size, and increased lung volume.
